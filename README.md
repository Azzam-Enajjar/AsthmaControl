AsthmaControl is an android application that helps asthma patients, aged 12 years or older, to monitor and control their asthma by providing a score that is calculated based on quantitative questionnaire data collected over time. The questions are a selection from the questionnaire recognized by the National Institutes of Health. The asthma control score,  which can be calculated at any given time, helps asthma patients and their health care providers determining whether the asthma is under control or not.

The application works on any Android device that supports API level 8 (Android 1.6 Donut) and above.
